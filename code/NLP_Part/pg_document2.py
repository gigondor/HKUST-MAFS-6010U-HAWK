In presenting this Work to public notice, I deem it not irrelevant to observe, that speculations similar to those which it records have, at different
periods, occupied my thoughts. In the spring of the present year my attention was directed to the question then moved between Sir W. Hamilton and
Professor De Morgan; and I was induced by the interest which it inspired,
to resume the almost-forgotten thread of former inquiries. It appeared to
me that, although Logic might be viewed with reference to the idea of
quantity,
it had also another and a deeper system of relations. If it was
lawful to regard it from without, as connecting itself through the medium
of Number with the intuitions of Space and Time, it was lawful also to
regard it from within, as based upon facts of another order which have
their abode in the constitution of the Mind. The results of this view, and
of the inquiries which it suggested, are embodied in the following Treatise.
It is not generally permitted to an Author to prescribe the mode in
which his production shall be judged; but there are two conditions which
I may venture to require of those who shall undertake to estimate the
merits of this performance. The first is, that no preconceived notion of
the impossibility of its objects shall be permitted to interfere with that
candour and impartiality which the investigation of Truth demands; the
second is, that their judgment of the system as a whole shall not be founded
either upon the examination of only a part of it, or upon the measure of its
conformity with any received system, considered as a standard of reference
from which appeal is denied. It is in the general theorems which occupy
the latter chapters of this work,results to which there is no existing
counterpart,that the claims of the method, as a Calculus of Deductive
Reasoning, are most fully set forth.
What may be the final estimate of the value of the system, I have
neither the wish nor the right to anticipate. The estimation of a theory is
not simply determined by its truth. It also depends upon the importance
of its subject, and the extent of its applications; beyond which something
must still be left to the arbitrariness of human Opinion. If the utility of
the application of Mathematical forms to the science of Logic were solely a
question of Notation, I should be content to rest the defence of this attempt
upon a principle which has been stated by an able living writer: Whenever
the nature of the subject permits the reasoning process to be without
danger carried on mechanically, the language should be constructed on as
mechanical principles as possible; while in the contrary case it should be
so constructed, that there shall be the greatest possible obstacle to a mere
mechanical use of it.
In one respect, the science of Logic differs from
all others; the perfection of its method is chiefly valuable as an evidence
of the speculative truth of its principles. To supersede the employment of
common reason, or to subject it to the rigour of technical forms, would
be the last desire of one who knows the value of that intellectual toil and
warfare which imparts to the mind an athletic vigour, and teaches it to
contend with difficulties and to rely upon itself in emergencies.
