The following work is not a republication of a former treatise by the Author,
entitled, The Mathematical Analysis of Logic. Its earlier portion is indeed
devoted to the same object, and it begins by establishing the same system of
fundamental laws, but its methods are more general, and its range of applications far wider. It exhibits the results, matured by some years of study and
reflection, of a principle of investigation relating to the intellectual operations,
the previous exposition of which was written within a few weeks after its idea
had been conceived.
That portion of this work which relates to Logic presupposes in its reader a
knowledge of the most important terms of the science, as usually treated, and
of its general object. On these points there is no better guide than Archbishop
Whatelys Elements of Logic, or Mr. Thomsons Outlines of the Laws of
Thought. To the former of these treatises, the present revival of attention to
this class of studies seems in a great measure due. Some acquaintance with the
principles of Algebra is also requisite, but it is not necessary that this application
should have been carried beyond the solution of simple equations. For the study
of those chapters which relate to the theory of probabilities, a somewhat larger
knowledge of Algebra is required, and especially of the doctrine of Elimination,
and of the solution of Equations containing more than one unknown quantity.
Preliminary information upon the subject-matter will be found in the special
treatises on Probabilities in Lardners Cabinet Cyclopdia, and the Library
of Useful Knowledge, the former of these by Professor De Morgan, the latter
by Sir John Lubbock; and in an interesting series of Letters translated from
the French of M. Quetelet. Other references will be given in the work. On
a first perusal the reader may omit at his discretion, Chapters x., xiv., and
xix., together with any of the applications which he may deem uninviting or
irrelevant.
In different parts of the work, and especially in the notes to the concluding
chapter, will be found references to various writers, ancient and modern, chiefly
designed to illustrate a certain view of the history of philosophy. With respect
to these, the Author thinks it proper to add, that he has in no instance given
a citation which he has not believed upon careful examination to be supported
either by parallel authorities, or by the general tenor of the work from which
it was taken. While he would gladly have avoided the introduction of anything
which might by possibility be construed into the parade of learning, he felt it
to be due both to his subject and to the truth, that the statements in the text
should be accompanied by the means of verification. And if now, in bringing
to its close a labour, of the extent of which few persons will be able to judge
from its apparent fruits, he may be permitted to speak for a single moment
of the feelings with which he has pursued, and with which he now lays aside,
his task, he would say, that he never doubted that it was worthy of his best
efforts; that he felt that whatever of truth it might bring to light was not a
private or arbitrary thing, not dependent, as to its essence, upon any human
opinion. He was fully aware that learned and able men maintained opinions
upon the subject of Logic directly opposed to the views upon which the entire
argument and procedure of his work rested. While he believed those opinions to
be erroneous, he was conscious that his own views might insensibly be warped
by an influence of another kind. He felt in an especial manner the danger of that
intellectual bias which long attention to a particular aspect of truth tends to
produce. But he trusts that out of this conflict of opinions the same truth will
but emerge the more free from any personal admixture; that its different parts
will be seen in their just proportion; and that none of them will eventually be
too highly valued or too lightly regarded because of the prejudices which may
attach to the mere form of its exposition.
To his valued friend, the Rev. George Stephens Dickson, of Lincoln, the
Author desires to record his obligations for much kind assistance in the revision
of this work, and for some important suggestions.
