An increased interest in the history of the exact sciences
manifested in recent years by teachers everywhere, and the
attention given to historical inquiry in the mathematical
class-rooms and seminaries of our leading universities, cause
me to believe that a brief general History of Mathematics will
be found acceptable to teachers and students.
The pages treatingnecessarily in a very condensed form
of the progress made during the present century, are put forth
with great diffidence, although I have spent much time in
the effort to render them accurate and reasonably complete.
Many valuable suggestions and criticisms on the chapter on
Recent Times have been made by Dr. E. W. Davis, of the
University of Nebraska. The proof-sheets of this chapter have
also been submitted to Dr. J. E. Davies and Professor C. A.
Van Velzer, both of the University of Wisconsin; to Dr. G. B.
Halsted, of the University of Texas; Professor L. M. Hoskins, of
the Leland Stanford Jr. University; and Professor G. D. Olds,
of Amherst College,all of whom have afforded valuable
assistance. I am specially indebted to Professor F. H. Loud, of
Colorado College, who has read the proof-sheets throughout.
To all the gentlemen above named, as well as to Dr. Carlo
Veneziani of Salt Lake City, who read the first part of my work
in manuscript, I desire to express my hearty thanks. But in
acknowledging their kindness, I trust that I shall not seem to
lay upon them any share in the responsibility for errors which
I may have introduced in subsequent revision of the text.
