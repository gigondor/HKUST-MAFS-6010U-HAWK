The biggest in history! Despise technology released object detection data set Objects365 far more than ImageNet image data set larger than ImageNet. On April 16th, Zhiyuan Research Institute released the "Beijing Zhiyuan Scholars Program" and announced the joint construction of Beijing Zhiyuan - Defiance Intelligent Model Design and Image Perception Joint Lab. At the joint lab conference, Despise Technology released the universal object detection dataset Objects365, which contains 630,000 images, covering 365 categories, up to 10 million frames, far exceeding the datasets such as ImageNet and COCO. In addition, a CVPR Workshop competition for this data set was launched. Sun Jian, chief scientist of Defiance Technology, introduced Objects365, a general object detection dataset recently released by the Institute, which includes a total of 630,000 images, covering 365 categories, up to 10 million frames, surpassing Pascal VOC, ImageNet. , COCO data set. The data set includes 14 categories of people, clothing, living room, bathroom, kitchen, office, electrical appliances, transportation, food, fruits, vegetables, animals, sports, and musical instruments. Each category has dozens of subcategories. If only 80 and 20 categories included in the COCO and VOC datasets are considered, Objects365 is still superior to COCO and VOC in the average number of frames and the number of categories per image, and the index is reduced during the labeling process. The area of ??the marked area also exceeds COCO and VOC. In addition, in terms of the categories covered by each image, the Objects365 coverage category is broader than the previous dataset.
